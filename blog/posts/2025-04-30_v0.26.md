Smallweb 0.26 is a small release, with a few bug fixes and improvements.

I'll be presenting smallweb in the [Future of Coding meetup](https://lu.ma/6531cavq?tk=eUqyR0) tonight, make sure to register if you want to join us!

## Support for multiple log formats

There is a new `--log-format` flag in the `smallweb up` command. You can now choose between `json`, `text`, and `pretty` (default). If you want to keep the current behavior, set the `--log-format` flag to `json`.

## Multiple fields moved back to the `smallweb.json` config

I was annoyed to have to exit the current folder when managing private routes or setting up crons, so I decided to move the following fields back to the `smallweb.json` config:

- `private`
- `privateRoutes`
- `publicRoutes`
- `crons`

## Added `--force` flag to the `smallweb link` command

The `smallweb link` command allows you to easily create symlinks in your smallweb folder. It now has a `--force` flag that will overwrite existing symlinks.

## Removed `SMALLWEB_DOMAIN` and `SMALLWEB_ADDITIONAL_DOMAINS` env variables

The `SMALLWEB_DOMAIN` and `SMALLWEB_ADDITIONAL_DOMAINS` env variables where problematic when using the vscode or raycast extension. I prefer these informations to be explicitly set in the config file.
