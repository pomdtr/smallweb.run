Hey! You might have noticed that the pace of smallweb releases has slowed down a bit on january. This is due to multiple reason:

- I've been focused on other open-source projects (ex: [sunbeam](https://sunbeam.pomdtr.me) and [tweety](https://github.com/pomdtr/tweety))
- I've iterated a lot on smallweb cloud (if you're not already on the waitlist, make sure to [signup](https://cloud.smallweb.run))

But I'm back with a new release, with small but important improvements!

## SSH improvements

### Fixed permissions in sftp server

Smallweb bundles an SSH server, allowing you to access the cli and edit your files from anywhere.

```sh
smallweb up --ssh-addr :2222
```

Previously, when using the sftp server (`sftp -P 2222 _@smallweb.run`), the working directory was set to the smallweb dir, but you were able to navigate outside of it.

In smallweb 0.21, I have fixed the permissions so that the smallweb dir is the root of the sftp filesystem.

If you access an app using `sftp -P 2222 <app>@smallweb.run`, you will only be able to access the app's directory and its subdirectories.

### Granular Permissions

In order to interact with the ssh server, your public key needs to be added to the `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.smallweb/authorized_keys` file.

This pattern is powerful, since it allows:

- multiple users to access the same smallweb instance
- push files to the server from your CI/CD pipeline
- ...

But previously, there was only one permission level: full access to the smallweb instance.

From now on, you can add a public key to a `$SMALLWEB_DIR/<app>/authorized_keys` file to only give write access to a specific app.

## Improved handling of SPAs

By default, the smallweb file-server is not suited for Single Page Applications (SPAs) because it does not serve the `index.html` file when the requested file is not found.

In smallweb 0.21, you can now fixes the behavior by creating the following `_redirects` file at the root of your app:

```sh
/*  /index.html  200
```

## Removed some core commands

With smallweb support for plugins, I have decided removed a bunch of core commands that were previously available in the CLI.

- `smallweb service`
- `smallweb sync`
- `smallweb upgrade`
- `smallweb changelog`

Most of those commands were just wrappers on top of existing tools (ex: `mutagen`, `launchctl/systemd`, `sops`...).

The `smallweb upgrade` command was problematic when you installed smallweb using `brew` and I have decided to remove it.

You can easily recreate it by creating the following script at `~/smallweb/.smallweb/plugins/upgrade.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

curl -sSfL https://install.smallweb.run | sh
```

## Community Apps

- [smallblog](https://github.com/tayzendev/smallblog) by [@tayzendev](https://github.com/tayzendev) was updated, with an improved routing system!
