This release is a smaller one, but I still managed to pack a few new features in it.

This release address one of the hardest problem I had to deal with in smallweb: how to handle secrets, and store them securely at rest.

<!-- more -->

I'm especially interested in feedbacks for this one, as it's a feature that I'm not sure I got right on the first try.

## `smallweb secrets`: Encrypted secrets with sops

Smallweb will automatically decrypt sops-encoded `secrets.enc.env` files either stored in:

- the app dir (for app-scoped secrets)
- the `$SMALLWEB_DIR/.smallweb` dir (for global secrets)

These encrypted secrets can be pushed directly to a public git repository, or to [smallweb cloud](https://cloud.smallweb.run) in the future.

This feature uses [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops) behind the scene. Compared to other solutions, it has the advantage of being able to encrypt secrets with multiple keys, so that you can share them with your team.

A guide on how to use this new command is available at <https://www.smallweb.run/docs/guides/secrets.html>.

Thanks to [Taras Glek](https://taras.glek.net/) for suggesting the feature, and providing me feedbacks on early drafts.

## `smallweb doctor`

In order to check that your smallweb install is working, just run `smallweb doctor`.

```console
$ smallweb doctor
üîç Checking smallweb directory...
‚úÖ Smallweb directory found

üîç Checking Deno version...
‚úÖ Deno version is compatible (2.1.1)

üéâ smallweb is healthy
```

## `--template` flag for `list` and `log` commands

You can now create your own template using the `--template flag`

```console
$ smallweb log --template '{{ .Request.Method }} {{ .Requ
est.Url }} {{ .Response.Status }}'
GET https://www.localhost/ 200
GET https://www.localhost/assets/app.FvvarCLS.js 200
GET https://www.localhost/assets/chunks/theme.DAOtfCYV.js 200

```

Use `smallweb log --template '{{ json . }}'` to discover the available fields

## Built-in support for Static Site Generators

If your app contains no `main.[js,ts,jsx,tsx]` file at the root, and a `dist/index.html` file, smallweb will statically serve the content of the `dist` folder.

This allows smallweb to play well with most Static Site Generators, such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

If your SSG uses another folder than `dist`, you can specify it in the `smallweb.json` file:

```json
{
    // ex: lume use the "_site" folder by default
    "root": "_site",
}
```

## Completions support for nushell, elvish, and others

Smallweb now has an hidden `_carapace` command that can be used to generate completions for your hipster shell.

It's based on the [carapace](https://carapace.sh/) library, checkout the docs for more information.

## Alpha release of the vscode integration

You can help test out an alpha version of the vscode integration: <https://jsr.io/@smallweb/vscode>

```ts
import { VSCode } from "jsr:@smallweb/vscode@0.1.0"

const vscode = new VSCode()

export default vscode;
```

Paired with the `admin` apps API, it allows you to edit your whole smallweb dir from smallweb!

## What's next

### Youtube channel

I intend to start a youtube channel to provide more in-depth tutorials on how to use smallweb.

### VSCode integration

There a still a lot of feature to add to the vscode integration, such as:

- support for quick open
- support for search
- syncing extensions between devices

### Smallweb Cloud

The secrets encryption was a necessary step for the upcoming Smallweb Cloud.

If you are interested in testing it out, please add your email to the [waiting list](https://cloud.smallweb.run).
