## Updated Routing

After a lot of feedback shared by community, the routing was rethinked from the
ground up. Thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts!

Here is what your smallweb root folder (which defaults to `~/smallweb`) should
now look like:

```txt
~/smallweb/
├── localhost
│   ├── example
│   │   └── main.ts
│   └── react
│       └── main.ts
├── pomdtr.me
│   └── www
│       └── main.ts
└── smallweb.run
    ├── www
    │   └── main.ts
    ├── assets
    │   └── main.ts
    └── readme
        └── main.ts
```

<!-- more -->

The first level of subfolder is the apex domain, and the second one is the
subdomain.

- `https://assets.smallweb.run` will be routed to
  `~/smallweb/smallweb.run/assets/`
- `react.localhost` will be routed to `~/smallweb/localhost/react/`

Request targeting the apex domain will be automatically redirected to the `www`
subdomain.

You can read more about the design process in the
[dedicated blog post](./2024-07-11_routing-design).

## smallweb list

The smallweb dump command was renamed to `smallweb list`.

Smallweb list supports both human and machine readable output (with a `--json`
flag).

You can filter by domain using the `--domain` flag.

## smallweb open

The `smallweb open` command can now open smallweb websites, even when your
current directory is not the root of a smallweb app.

Just pass the app name to the command:

```sh
smallweb open react.localhost
```

The command provides completions, make sure to set them properly. You can get
shell specific instructions using the `smallweb help completion` command.
