# Getting started

## Why Smallweb ?

Smallweb is a new take on self-hosting. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to host your own apps. To achieve this, it uses a "file-based hosting" approach: every subfolder in your smallweb folder becomes a unique domain.

Smallweb is obsessed with scaling down. No dev server or a build is required, and you don't even need to care about deployment. You can just write a single file, hit save, and voila! Your app is live.

## Live Demo

A shared public instance of smallweb is available at [demo.smallweb.live](https://demo.smallweb.live). You can use it to test smallweb without setting up your own instance.

Please ping me either on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pomdtr.me) or [discord](https://discord.gg/BsgQK42qZe) if the demo is down.
