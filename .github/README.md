# smallweb.run

This repository is a monorepo of all my apps running under the smallweb.run domain.

I use the [push plugin](../.smallweb/plugins/push.sh) to commit and push changes to this repository.

These files are edited locally, and I use [mutagen](https://mutagen.io) to sync them to my VPS.

If you have your own instance of smallweb, you can copy any folder from this repository to your own smallweb folder.
